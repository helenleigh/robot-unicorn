stupid robot unicorn

I made a stupid gesture controlled robot unicorn because I was bored with personality free robots that move in a straight line. This is a cheap, unreliable, hilarious robot unicorn suitable for beginners. Have fun!

STEPS

1. Get your ingredients together. You'll need.... 

- 1 microbit or 2 if you want to make one that is gesture controlled (you do)
- 2 360 servos with wheels (I use FS90R with wheels like this https://www.kitronik.co.uk/2574-wheel-for-fs90r-60mmx8mm.html)
- A small stabilising wheel 
- A4 card
- Some kind of horn (I 3D printed mine)
- Tinsel 
- Some double sided sticky tape

Make the unicorn body. You can download the ai or pdf files and either lasercut them on card (there are two layers, one for cut and one for score) or print them out on A4 card and use a scalpel or scissors to cut and score them by hand. I've even done a step by step instruction video on my youtube channel.
